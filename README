It is hosted at the FTN for Perl project at Sourceforge and the original code
for it can be browsed for in the SVN repository at:
 http://ftnpl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ftnpl/trunk/scripts/BBBS/bconfhtm/
The current code for it can be found at the GIT repository at the ftnapps
project at GitHub:  
http://github.com/ftnapps/bconfhtm.

Archives of it can be found in the Project file downloads section.  They can
also be found on any FTN system that carries the BBBSUTIL File Echo, which is
distributed via the Filegate (www.filegate.net). Or they can be obtained from
the downloads section of the bconfhtm repository at GitHub.com/ftnapps/bconfhtm.

The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing lists are available from the project site;
however, the FTN echo BBBS.ENGLISH is the preferred avenue for support.
