It is hosted at the FTN for Perl project at Sourceforge and the current code for it can be browsed at:
http://ftnpl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ftnpl/trunk/scripts/BBBS/bconfhtm/

Archives of it can be found in the Project file downloads section.  They can also be found on any FTN
system that carries the BBBSUTIL File Echo, which is distributed via the Filegate (www.filegate.net).

The ftnpl-user or ftnpl-develop mailing lists are available from the project site;
however, the FTN echo BBBS.ENGLISH is the preferred avenue for support.
